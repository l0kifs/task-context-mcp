# Task Implementation Guide

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:** AI agents MUST strictly follow each rule in this guide when performing any task related to creating or updating project functionality.

When a new task is assigned to you, follow these steps to implement it effectively:
1. Analyze the project in detail using mcp repomix.
2. Split the task implementation into a list of small finalized steps.
3. Save the list of steps in new md file <TASK_NAME>-implementation-plan.md in /docs/tasks/ directory.
4. Implement the steps one by one following the Steps Implementation Guide.

## Steps Implementation Guide

Every step includes next actions:
1. Read the document <TASK_NAME>-implementation-plan.md and find the current step to implement.
2. Implement functionality described in the step.
3. Implement all required tests for the new functionality.
4. Test the existing and new functionality with all tests in the project.
5. Fix all the issues found during testing.
6. Repeat testing (step 4) and fixing (step 5) steps until all issues fixed.
7. Summarize the work done and mark current step as completed in <TASK_NAME>-implementation-plan.md.
8. Return control to user for review.
